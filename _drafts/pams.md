# About

This is our Capstone project, equivalent to a final year project in other universities. The project is a collaboration with KLASS Engineering and Solutions.

Personnel and Artefact Monitoring System (PAMS) is an anti-theft solution that utilises reliable, robust technology for precise, real-time localisation of personnel and sensitive objects within specified environments. PAMS is designed to provide security and enhance operational efficiency. It is both scalable and cost-efficient. It also integrates with existing network infrastructures to provide detailed analytics, enabling effective resource monitoring and management across various sectors.
