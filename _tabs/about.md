# CasKei's Personal Site

This is my personal site, where I write about my thoughts, projects, and other things that I find interesting. I am passionate about offensive security and forensics, and I am always looking for opportunities to learn more about these fields.


I am currently actively job-seeking for roles related to offensive security or operations, so if you have any opportunities or would like to chat, feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn!

## Background

I am a recent graduate from Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), where I majored in Computer Science and Design (CSD), under two specialisation tracks: Cybersecurity and IoT and Intelligent Systems. I also have two minors: Artificial Intelligence and Digital Humanities.

I have accumulated many academic projects and experiences in the fields of cybersecurity, software development, and design. I also interned at A*STAR's Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) where I worked on projects related to cryptography, and worked with fellow passionate teammates with diverse backgrounds.

## Personal interests

Since young, I have been interested in starting my own blog and writing. This site is a platform for me to share my thoughts and experiences, and to document my journey. I take pride in my writing, but after putting it down to focus on my studies, I am now back to writing and sharing my thoughts with the world. As such, this site shall be text-focused as so, and I hope you enjoy reading my posts.
